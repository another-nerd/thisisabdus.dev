An issue tracker could be piece of software hosted locally on your local system. Or a web-app hosted publicly somewhere around the world. Basically what it does is, it tracks down all your issues from different code repositories like GitHub, GitLab etc and help you organize those issues so that you don't miss-out anything.

### Why should one use an Issue Tracker

Because, you want all your issues in single place to work on them efficiently, right? I mean, people could open new issues in every repositories. But, don't you think it is tedious for you to look at different repositories? What if you forget to work on an issue just because you were too lazy to open each and every repository and check issues because GH doesn't provide a way to look bring them all in one place?

Answer is really sweet. **Use an Issue Tracker**. Bring everything under a single roof. Keep yourself accountable on what issue you're working on. Isn't that a cool idea?

### Benefits

There are a lot of benefits of using an tracker. Well, just look into it from a general human's perspective. Everybody want to keep themselves organized with their tasks, right?

A few benefits I am listing here:

* Easier to keep track of what you are doing with your projects
* Give your end users an approximate idea about how much time the developers would need to _close_ certain number of issues
* Work efficiently. Don't left behind just because you forget a lot f things like me

So, start using an issue tracker for all of your projects(build one if you can't find any of your choice). Doesn't matter if you're working on personal project or hip something for the world. Every project is important! Don't miss out a single issue!

Have a great day ahead!
